#1 Internal-project Dobrogo-vechora-LIGHT

This is the site of Vinnytsia's IT Academy "INTITA," designed for students to enhance their skills. 
It was my first project for my academy, "INTITA." 
I collaborated with other students like myself, working seamlessly and always ready to assist each other. 
Although it was challenging, it proved to be very interesting.

My contributions to this site include:
   * Favicon;
   * Block "Becoming our partner";
   * Creating a form to fill out, namely the Questionnaire for Program Partners;
   * Footer.

During my work on this project, I utilized HTML and CSS for typesetting. 
I learned how to use the Bootstrap library, convert and compress images, and work with Figma and Trello. 
The layout of the blocks is adaptive, ranging from the mobile version to the desktop version, ensuring correct display on tablets (with adaptive adjustments for both images and text). 
The form for data submission, which appears when you click on the "Join" button, operates using JavaScript code. 
This code checks entered data, validates the fields, and sends the information to the server. 
Upon successful registration, a confirmation message is displayed to the user.
